    " RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha, which represents a color model where each color component (red, green, and blue) is represented by an 8-bit value ranging from 0 to 255, indicating the intensity of the color. The alpha channel (A) represents the transparency or opacity of the color and is also an 8-bit value, where 0 means completely transparent (invisible) and 255 means completely opaque (fully visible).\n",

    "In Python, RGBA colors are often represented as tuples of four integers ranging from 0 to 255, denoting the red, green, blue, and alpha values, respectively. For example, the RGBA tuple (255, 0, 0, 128) represents a semi-transparent red color, where the red component is fully saturated (255), the green and blue components are zero, and the alpha component is partially transparent (128)."
